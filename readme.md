# CSE132B school databse project

## Milestone 2 check point

### Tomcat
We use the tomcat 9.0 as web server to display the database and query information on the website. We follow the setup video covered by the TA and config it in the Eclipse through Dynamic web project template.

### Tables in Database
All the table are created using the file cse132b.sql. You can find table instance and statment in that file.
